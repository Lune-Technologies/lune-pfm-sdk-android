# Components

The Lune SDK components are broadly divided into full-page views and
smaller (mix and match) components.

## Full page views

These components are typically large and were designed to be used as
stand-alone components on a page. While you could still choose to do so,
we strongly discourage adding other widgets as siblings to full page
views.

### Examples are

1. [Cashflow Component](full-page/cashflow-component.md)
2. [Expense Component](full-page/expense-component.md)
3. [Transaction List Component](full-page/transaction-list-component.md)
4. [Transaction Detail Component](full-page/transaction-detail-component.md)
5. [Brand Trends Component](full-page/brand-trends-component.md)
6. [Category Trends Component](full-page/category-trends-component.md)
7. [Category Spend List Component](full-page/category-spend-list-component.md)
8. [Brand List Component](full-page/brand-list-component.md)
9. [Budget Component](full-page/budget-component.md)

## Smaller (mix and match) Components

These components are usually small enough and could easily be arranged
as siblings of other widgets on a page.

### Examples are

1. [Cashflow Chart Component](smaller/cashflow-chart-component.md)
2. [Category Spend Chart Component](smaller/category-spend-chart-component.md)
3. [Category Trend Chart Component](smaller/category-trend-chart-component.md)
4. [Brand Trend Chart Component](smaller/brand-trend-chart-component.md)
5. [Budget Form Component](smaller/budget-form-component.md)
6. [Budget Summary Component](smaller/budget-summary-component.md)
