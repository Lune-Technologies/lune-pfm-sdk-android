# Customization

The SDK has lots of configurable parameters which can be overridden by setting up a `JSON` file with a schema similar to the one attached below. You could just download the file and modify the values you wish to change.

[lune_config.json](assets/lune_config.json)

Once edited, save the JSON file as `lune_config.json` and place it in the `/res/raw` directory of your Android project. The final path should be `/res/raw/lune_config.json`.
