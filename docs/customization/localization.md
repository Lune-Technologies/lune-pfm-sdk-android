# Localization and Strings

If your app is already localized, the SDK would be localized as well - no configurations needed. If your app is not localized, however, the SDK respects that and stays in English to preserve consistency and uniformity across your app.

## String Overrides

You can override specific strings by assigning a different value to the same string keys used by the SDK.

The strings used in the SDK can be found in the localization file attached below.

[lunesdk-localizations.zip](assets/lunesdk-localizations.zip)

As you may have noticed, the keys are unique and should not conflict with any other strings in your project.
